When you deploy an application to another computer, you must install the application itself and any library files that the application depends on. Visual C++ 2010 gives you three ways to deploy the Visual C++ runtime with an application: central deployment,
 local deployment, or static linking.

 Deployment

Central deployment means that your Visual C++ DLLs are installed in the System32 directory. To centrally deploy your application, you can use one of the following:


* The **VCRedist\_**architecture.exe command-line tool, where
architecture is **x32**, **x64**, or
**ia64**.
* Merge modules.


VCRedist\_architecture.exe installs all libraries for the specific hardware platform. Merge modules, or .msm files, provide a standard method by which developers deliver shared Windows Installer components and setup logic to
 their applications.


The main advantage of central deployment is emergency serviceability. If a critical security vulnerability is discovered, Microsoft automatically updates library files that are centrally-deployed.

Local deployment means that your application's library files are installed in the application folder. To deploy your application locally, simply copy the executable file and its associated library files into a folder.


Different library versions can exist side-by-side because the filenames contain the version number (for example, version 10 of the CRT DLL is msvcr100.dll).


Unlike centrally-deployed libraries, local libraries are not updated automatically by Microsoft. If you decide to use local deployment, you should also implement your own method of updating libraries.

 Linking

You can statically link your application to any library (such as CRT, MFC, or ATL) to produce an executable that has no dependencies on DLLs. The advantage of static linking is that deploying your application can be copied from one computer to another without
 also having to copy library files. If you use static linking and Microsoft updates the library that you linked to, your application cannot use the updated library.
